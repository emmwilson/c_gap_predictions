# c_gap_predictions
Reproducible code for analyses creating predictions of carbon and gap locations in Terra Nova and Gros Morne National Parks in Newfoundland

The analysis creates models analogous to species distribution models, but with the abundance of carbon, or presence absence of gaps, as the response variables.
